Module 15 - Leaflet Challenge - USGS Earthquake Visualization
-
The United States Geological Survey, (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Imported and visualized the data using the following:
Used Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes for the past 30 days based on their longitude and latitude.
The map inlcudes layer to toggle between the street map view and the topographic map
The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.
Included popups that provided the location, date, magniture and depth of the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
Created a legend to show the color range for the depth of the earthquake.
